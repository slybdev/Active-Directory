# Active-Directory

## Objective
The goal of this project was to build a controlled lab environment simulating real-world enterprise systems and security monitoring workflows. I integrated a Windows Active Directory domain, deployed a SIEM (Splunk), and performed attacks using a Kali Linux machine. The objective was to detect and analyze security events like brute-force attacks and simulate adversary techniques using Atomic Red Team.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Building and configuring enterprise-like environments (AD, DNS, static IPs)
- Log ingestion and parsing in Splunk from Windows endpoints
- Configuring Sysmon and Olaf config for detailed event logging
- Performing brute-force attacks and detecting Event ID patterns
- Working with Universal Forwarder and inputs.conf setup
- Hands-on experience with Atomic Red Team attack simulations

### Tools Used
- Splunk (SIEM)
- Splunk Universal Forwarder
- Windows Server 2019 (Domain Controller)
- Windows 10 (Target Endpoint)
- Ubuntu Server (Splunk host)
- Kali Linux (Attacker machine)
- Sysmon + Olaf config (for deep endpoint logging)
- Atomic Red Team (for simulated attacks)
- Crowbar (Cowpatty) (for brute-force attack)
